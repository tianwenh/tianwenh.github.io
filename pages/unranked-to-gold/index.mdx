## Backstory

It has been my 3rd season since my first league game.

I had never been a gamer, had zero interest, and played zero MOBA game before that.

In retrospection, the reason is quite similar to how I started learning music: picking a random area to explore, kill free time, with no goal and absolutely nothing to expect.

I played mostly normal, and ARAM for a while, somehow now turned into Sett OTP.

### S10

First season, I was mostly exploring things out, afraid of playing against real players, and ended up playing mostly "Co-op vs. AI" games. (Somehow, I was quite enjoying killing bots.)

### S11

This was when all the mythic items are introduced. With these breaking changes, I started researching on how item works, and tried to digest terms like damage, armor, penetration, on-hit effects.

I also did research on individual champions, like shyvana, pantheon, urgot, but was not really feeling confident on them.

I ended up with Sett for several reasons:

- Versatile role, top/mid/sup/jg;
- Strong solo/team fight;
- Absolutely adc bully when stridebreaker had a dash;

Finished my ranked placement, I ened up with silver 4 after 10 games and then never tried to climb.

Had a lot of fun with Stridebreaker, then "mathematically correct sett" when Riot removed dash on Stridebreaker.

### S12

In response to my one big thing one month initiative for 2022, I decided to do a 2 weeks ranked game challenge for February.

In turns of game play, I feel pretty stable and it seems to be a good time to evaluate against my current status.

## The ranked journey

Starting from 2/19, the journey concluded at 3/6.

I made it to Gold 4 1 LP after 153 games with 80W, 72L, 53% WR.

I made this LP gains graph to better visualize ranked journey:

import { LPGains } from './Charts';

### Replacements

Replacements are 10 games made with mostly unranked or Bronze players. I ended up with 4 wins (40% WR) only, and got placed at Bronze 3 87LP.

I only got owned 1 or 2 times during lane matches and was winning most of the time. However, unless I absolutely smashed the lane (e.g. can easily 1v2 or 3), toplane usually is hard to carry in low elo.

### Escaping Bronze

> You probably don't need to win lane to win game as toplane. Being stable and not lose too hard should naturally do the work.

It took me in total 25 games (13 wins) to silver after replacements.

Although after replacement, I jumped from Bronze 3 87LP to Bronze 1 1LP right after a win (thinking my MMR is higher), it still took a back and forth until Silver.
I failed my promo once and for the second time, it gives a free win. So instead of 3 wins out of 5, it will be 2 of 4.

The experience here is very similar to replacement games. I won most lane matches, but it obviously does not correlate to game win rate (52%).

### Silver 1/2 bottleneck

> Learn game as a whole and respect counter picks.

Similar to the bronze jump, I jumped from Silver 4 to 2 once I reached Silver 4 100LP.

Then... My LP was literally bouncing between Silver 2 and 1 for a long while.

Although I believe toplane has less impact for game. I do feel lane matches are more conditional after sliver 2.

For certain lane matchups, I am still confident winning, while for the other ones, I know for sure I will not be the carry, or even likely get bullied during lane phase. I will dive into matchup details in the later section.

This also educates me to think more than lane matchups: team fight, objectives, vision/map, camera control, wave management, farm...

### Let's go Gold

I honestly don't think my skill was improved, but more mental thinking during the silver 1 struggle.

Several factors that brings me to Gold:

- Just enough luck and time (not kidding);
- More granular build, rune, summs choices;
- Respect Counterpicks;
- Think about wave management, slow push;
- Pay attention to vision;
- Team fight with **active** objectives;
- General camera control and get information;
- Balance farm and support team;

See below for detailed breakdowns.

## My Sett OTP guidelines

### Common builds

Here are my commonly built items:

- Goredrinker: the default mythic item;
- Frostfire Gauntlet: when team needs tank, which is most of the time;
- Trinity Force: good for splitpush and solo fight;
- Death's Dance: when in big lead;
- Hullbreaker: for good gold efficiency;
- Black Cleaver: vs tank and late game;
- Blade of The Ruined King: lane sustain and vs tank / bruisers;
- Titanic Hydra: mid game and split push;
- Sterak's Gage: mid/late game team fight;
- Maw of Malmortius/Force of Nature: against AP team;
- Thornmail: for anti-heal;
- Gargoyle Stoneplate: late game against burst damage;
- Guardian Angel: super late game for win or go home final fight;

### Runes, summs and builds

#### Against ranged

Common ranged champions: Teemo, Gangplank, Karma, Vayne, Quinn, Gnar.

My setups:

- Fleet Footwork, Resolve, Revitalize;
- Flash/TP;
- Doran shield;
- Mercury's Treads or Plated Steelcaps first item;
  - Fater move speed;
  - Defensive item in synergy with rune and Doran shield;
- Hullbreaker, or Frostfire Gauntlet, or Thornmail next;

In summary, it is pretty defensive / passive, usually hard to win lane.

The goal is to farm and prepare for split push or team fight with TP.

A better suggestion here is probably to learn other counter champions...

#### Against tanks

Common tanks: Malphite, Cho'Gath, Mundo, Shen, Sion, Tahm Kench, Nasus, Volibear, Ornn.

My setups:

- Lethal Tempo;
- Flash/Ignite;
- Doran blade;
- Blade of The Ruined King first item;
- Hullbreaker, or Trinity Force or Goredrinker next;
- Black Cleaver for late game;

Tanks usually scale better than Sett. The goal is to stop them early game, especially for low elo, games are in general long.

If Sett does not suppress them pre level-x, Sett is easily owned by them in solo fight/splitpush.

Good news is, during teamfight, Sett's ult is a well counter againt tanks.

#### Against bruiser

Common bruiser are: Garen, Darius, Aatrox, Jax, Irelia, Mordekaiser, Illaoi, Urgot, Trundle, Fiora, Gwen.

My setups are:

- Lethal Tempo/Conq;
- Flash/Ignite;
- Doran blade;
- Blade of The Ruined King or Hullbreaker first item depending on matchups;
- Frostfire Gauntlet or Goredrinker next;

These matchups are also case by case, and mostly skill based.

Similar to "against tanks", Sett needs to win early game here as well.

### Champion matchups

- Easy win: Irelia, Malphite, Garen, Camille, Shen, Jax, Sion, Yone, Singed, Gragas, Urgot, Yorick, Gwen, Nasus;
- Skill based, likely win: Darius, Fiora, Aatrox, Riven, Jayce, Poppy, Renekton, Kennen, Yasuo, Kayle, Wukong;
- Skill based, likely lose: Tryndamere, Gangplank, Akali, Tahm Kench, Gnar, Graves, Mordekaiser, Illaoi, Ornn, Cho'Gath, Volibear, Trundle, Dr. Mundo;
- JG Welp: Vayne, Quinn, Teemo, Heimerdinger

## What's next

While I might be able to climb higher as Sett OTP, I think it is a good time to stop and chill again and invest on other champions, especially think in terms of fixing my weak lane matches. There are other general micro and macros to improve.

I might have another post gold to plat or diamond in the future :/
