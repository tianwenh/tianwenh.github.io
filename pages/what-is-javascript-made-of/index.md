During my first few years of using JavaScript, I felt like a fraud. Even though I could build websites with frameworks, something was missing. I dreaded JavaScript job interviews because I didn't have a solid grasp on fundamentals.

Over the years, I've formed a mental model of JavaScript that gave me confidence. Here, I'm sharing a **very compressed** version of it. It's structured like a glossary, with each topic getting a few sentences.

As you read through this post, try to mentally keep score about how _confident_ you feel about each topic. I won't judge you if quite a few of them are a miss! At the end of this post, there is something that might help in that case.

---

- **Value**: The concept of a value is a bit abstract. It's a "thing". A value to JavaScript is what a number is to math, or what a point is to geometry. When your program runs, its world is full of values. Numbers like `1`, `2`, and `420` are values, but so are some other things, like this sentence: `"Cows go moo"`. Not _everything_ is a value though. A number is a value, but an `if` statement is not. We'll look at a few different kinds of values below.

  - **Type of Value**: There are a few different "types" of values. For example, _numbers_ like `420`, _strings_ like `"Cows go moo"`, _objects_, and a few other types. You can learn a type of some value by putting `typeof` before it. For example, `console.log(typeof 2)` prints `"number"`.
  - **Primitive Values**: Some value types are "primitive". They include numbers, strings, and a few other types. One peculiar thing about primitive values is that you can't create more of them, or change them in any way. For example, every time you write `2`, you get the _same_ value `2`. You can't "create" another `2` in your program, or make the `2` _value_ "become" `3`. This is also true for strings.
  - **`null` and `undefined`**: These are two special values. They're special because there's a lot of things you can't do with them -- they often cause errors. Usually, `null` represents that some value is missing intentionally, and `undefined` represents that a value is missing unintentionally. However, when to use either is left to the programmer. They exist because sometimes it's better for an operation to fail than to proceed with a missing value.

- **Equality**: Like "value", equality is a fundamental concept in JavaScript. We say two values are equal when they're... actually, I'd never say that. If two values are equal, it means they _are_ the same value. Not two different values, but one! For example, `"Cows go moo" === "Cows go moo"` and `2 === 2` because `2` _is_ `2`. Note we use _three_ equal signs to represent this concept of equality in JavaScript.

  - **Strict Equality**: Same as above.
  - **Referential Equality**: Same as above.
  - **Loose Equality**: Oof, this one is different! Loose equality is when we use _two_ equal signs (`==`). Things may be considered _loosely equal_ even if they refer to _different_ values that look similar (such as `2` and `"2"`). It was added to JavaScript early on for convenience and has caused endless confusion ever since. This concept is not fundamental, but is a common source of mistakes. You can learn how it works on a rainy day, but many people try to avoid it.

- **Literal**: A literal is when you refer to a value by _literally_ writing it down in your program. For example, `2` is a _number literal_, and `"Banana"` is a _string literal_.

- **Variable**: A variable lets you refer to some value using a name. For example, `let message = "Cows go moo"`. Now you can write `message` instead of repeating the same sentence every time in your code. You may later change `message` to point to another value, like `message = "I am the walrus"`. Note this doesn't change _the value itself_, but only where the `message` points to, like a "wire". It pointed to `"Cows go moo"`, and now it points to `"I am the walrus"`.
  - **Scope**: It would suck if there could only be one `message` variable in the whole program. Instead, when you define a variable, it becomes available in a _part_ of your program. That part is called a "scope". There are rules about how scope works, but usually you can search for the closest `{` and `}` braces around where you define the variable. That "block" of code is its scope.
  - **Assignment**: When we write `message = "I am the walrus"`, we change the `message` variable to point to `"I am the walrus"` value. This is called an assignment, writing, or setting the variable.
  - **`let` vs `const` vs `var`**: Usually you want `let`. If you want to forbid assignment to this variable, you can use `const`. (Some codebases and coworkers are pedantic and force you to use `const` when there is only one assignment.) Avoid `var` if you can because its scoping rules are confusing.
- **Object**: An object is a special kind of value in JavaScript. The cool thing about objects is that they can have connections to other values. For example, a `{flavor: "vanilla"}` object has a `flavor` property that points to the `"vanilla"` value. Think of an object as "your own" value with "wires" from it.

  - **Property**: A property is like a "wire" sticking from an object and pointing to some value. It might remind you of a variable: it has a name (like `flavor`) and points to a value (like `"vanilla"`). But unlike a variable, a property "lives" _in_ the object itself rather than in some place in your code (scope). A property is considered a part of the object -- but the value it points to is not.
  - **Object Literal**: An object literal is a way to create an object value by _literally_ writing it down in your program, like `{}` or `{flavor: "vanilla"}`. Inside `{}`, we can have multiple `property: value` pairs separated by commas. This lets us set up where the property "wires" point to from our object.
  - **Object Identity**: We mentioned earlier that `2` is _equal_ to `2` (in other words, `2 === 2`) because whenever we write `2`, we "summon" the same value. But whenever we write `{}`, we will always get a _different_ value! So `{}` is _not equal_ to another `{}`. Try this in console: `{} === {}` (the result is false). When the computer meets `2` in our code, it always gives us the same `2` value. However, object literals are different: when a computer meets `{}`, it _creates a new object, which is always a new value_. So what is object identity? It's yet another term for equality, or same-ness of values. When we say “`a` and `b` have the same identity", we mean “`a` and `b` point to the _same_ value" (`a === b`). When we say “`a` and `b` have different identities", we mean “`a` and `b` point to _different_ values" (`a !== b`).
  - **Dot Notation**: When you want to read a property from an object or assign to it, you can use the dot (`.`) notation. For example, if a variable `iceCream` points to an object whose property `flavor` points to `"chocolate"`, writing `iceCream.flavor` will give you `"chocolate"`.
  - **Bracket Notation**: Sometimes you don't know the name of the property you want to read in advance. For example, maybe sometimes you want to read `iceCream.flavor` and sometimes you want to read `iceCream.taste`. The bracket (`[]`) notation lets you read the property when _its name itself_ is a variable. For example, let's say that `let ourProperty = 'flavor'`. Then `iceCream[ourProperty]` will give us `"chocolate"`. Curiously, we can use it when creating objects too: `{ [ourProperty]: "vanilla" }`.
  - **Mutation**: We say an object is _mutated_ when somebody changes its property to point to a different value. For example, if we declare `let iceCream = {flavor: "vanilla"}`, we can later _mutate_ it with `iceCream.flavor = "chocolate"`. Note that even if we used `const` to declare `iceCream`, we could still mutate `iceCream.flavor`. This is because `const` would only prevent assignments to the `iceCream` _variable itself_, but we mutated a _property_ (`flavor`) of the object it pointed to. Some people swore off using `const` altogether because they find this too misleading.
  - **Array**: An array is an object that represents a list of stuff. When you write an _array literal_ like `["banana", "chocolate", "vanilla"]`, you essentially create an object whose property called `0` points to the `"banana"` string value, property called `1` points to the `"chocolate"` value, and property called `2` points to the `"vanilla"` value. It would be annoying to write `{0: ..., 1: ..., 2: ...}` which is why arrays are useful. There are also some built-in ways to operate on arrays, like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`. Don't despair if `reduce` seems confusing -- it's confusing to everyone.
  - **Prototype**: What happens if we read a property that doesn't exist? For example, `iceCream.taste` (but our property is called `flavor`). The simple answer is we'll get the special `undefined` value. The more nuanced answer is that most objects in JavaScript have a "prototype". You can think of a prototype as a "hidden" property on every object that determines "where to look next". So if there's no `taste` property on `iceCream`, JavaScript will look for a `taste` property on its prototype, then on _that_ object's prototype, and so on, and will only give us `undefined` if it reaches the end of this "prototype chain" without finding `.taste`. You will rarely interact with this mechanism directly, but it explains why our `iceCream` object has a `toString` method that we never defined -- it comes from the prototype.

- **Function**: A function is a special value with one purpose: it represents _some code in your program_. Functions are handy if you don't want to write the same code many times. "Calling" a function like `sayHi()` tells the computer to run the code inside it and then go back to where it was in the program. There are many ways to define a function in JavaScript, with slight differences in what they do.
  - **Arguments (or Parameters)**: Arguments let you pass some information to your function from the place you call it: `sayHi("Amelie")`. Inside the function, they act similar to variables. They're called either "arguments" or "parameters" depending on which side you're reading (function definition or function call). However, this distinction in terminology is pedantic, and in practice these two terms are used interchangeably.
  - **Function Expression**: Previously, we set a variable to a _string value_, like `let message = "I am the walrus"`. It turns out that we can also set a variable to a _function_, like `let sayHi = function() { }`. The thing after `=` here is called a _function expression_. It gives us a special value (a function) that represents our piece of code, so we can call it later if we want to.
  - **Function Declaration**: It gets tiring to write something like `let sayHi = function() { }` every time, so we can use a shorter form instead: `function sayHi() { }`. This is called a _function declaration_. Instead of specifying the variable name on the left, we put it after the `function` keyword. These two styles are mostly interchangeable.
  - **Function Hoisting**: Normally, you can only use a variable after its declaration with `let` or `const` has run. This can be annoying with functions because they may need to call each other, and it's hard to track which function is used by which others and needs to be defined first. As a convenience, when (and only when!) you use the _function declaration_ syntax, the order of their definitions doesn't matter because they get "hoisted". This is a fancy way of saying that conceptually, they all automatically get moved to the top of the scope. By the time you call them, they're all defined.
  - **`this`**: Probably the most misunderstood JavaScript concept, `this` is like a special argument to a function. You don't pass it to a function yourself. Instead, JavaScript itself passes it, depending on _how you call_ the function. For example, calls using the dot `.` notation -- like `iceCream.eat()` -- will get a special `this` value from whatever is before the `.` (in our example, `iceCream`). The value of `this` inside a function depends on how the function is _called_, not where it's defined. Helpers like `.bind`, `.call`, and `.apply` let you have for more control over the value of `this`.
  - **Arrow Functions**: Arrow functions are similar to function expressions. You declare them like this: `let sayHi = () => { }`. They're concise and are often used for one-liners. Arrow functions are _more limited_ than regular functions -- for example, they have no concept of `this` whatsoever. When you write `this` inside of an arrow function, it uses `this` of the closest "regular" function above. This is similar to what would happen if you used an argument or a variable that only exists in a function above. Practically, this means that people use arrow functions when they want to "see" the same `this` inside of them as in the code surrounding them.
  - **Function Binding**: Usually, _binding_ a function `f` to a particular `this` value and arguments means creating a _new_ function that calls `f` with those predefined values. JavaScript has a built-in helper to do it called `.bind`, but you could also do it by hand. Binding was a popular way to make nested functions "see" the same value of `this` as the outer functions. But now this use case is handled by arrow functions, so binding is not used as often.
  - **Call Stack**: Calling a function is like entering a room. Every time we call a function, the variables inside of it are initialized all over again. So each function call is like _constructing_ a new "room" with its code and entering it. Our function's variables "live" in that room. When we return from the function, that "room" disappears with all its variables. You can visualize these rooms as a vertical stack of rooms -- a _call stack_. When we exit a function, we go back to the function "below" it on the call stack.
  - **Recursion**: Recursion means that a function calls itself from within itself. This is useful for when you want to repeat the thing you just did in your function _again_, but for different arguments. For example, if you're writing a search engine that crawls the web, your `collectLinks(url)` function might first collect the links from a page, and then _call itself_ for every _link_ until it visits all pages. The pitfall with recursion is that it's easy to write code that never finishes because a function keeps calling itself forever. If this happens, JavaScript will stop it with an error called "stack overflow". It's called this way because it means we have too many function calls stacked in our call stack, and it has literally overflown.
  - **Higher-Order Function**: A higher-order function is a function that deals with other functions by taking them as arguments or returning them. This might seem weird at first, but we should remember that functions are values so we can pass them around -- like we do with numbers, strings, or objects. This style can be overused, but it's very expressive in moderation.
  - **Callback**: A callback is not really a JavaScript term. It's more of a pattern. It's when you pass a function as an argument to another function, expecting it to _call your function back later_. You're expecting a "call back". For example, `setTimeout` takes a _callback_ function and... calls you back after a timeout. But there's nothing special about callback functions. They're regular functions, and when we say "callback" we only talk about our expectations.
  - **Closure**: Normally, when you exit a function, all its variables "disappear". This is because nothing needs them anymore. But what if you declare a function _inside_ a function? Then the inner function could still be called later, and read the variables of the _outer_ function. In practice, this is very useful! But for this to work, the outer function's variables need to "stick around" somewhere. So in this case, JavaScript takes care of "keeping the variables alive" instead of "forgetting" them as it would usually do. This is called a "closure". While closures are often considered a misunderstood JavaScript aspect, you probably use them many times a day without realizing it!

JavaScript is made of these concepts, and more. I felt very anxious about my knowledge of JavaScript until I could build a correct mental model, and I'd like to help the next generation of developers bridge this gap sooner.

If you want to join me for a deeper dive in each of these topics, I have something for you. **[Just JavaScript](https://justjavascript.com/) is my distilled mental model of how JavaScript works, and it's going to feature visual illustrations by the amazing [Maggie Appleton](https://illustrated.dev/)**. Unlike this post, it goes at a slower pace so you can follow along on every detail.

_Just JavaScript_ is in a very early stage so it's only available as a series of emails with zero polish or editing. If this project sounds interesting, you can [sign up](https://justjavascript.com/) to receive free drafts by email. I will be grateful for your feedback. Thank you!
