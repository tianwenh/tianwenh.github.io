## Why learning Jazz

> All Roads Lead to Jazz.

Joke aside, what are the common paths?

### Music paths and What is Jazz

*(Very opinionated personal view. Obviously, these paths are not entirely orthogonal)*

- Pop / Rock / Modern path
  - **Audience focused**
    - Songwriting
    - Production
    - Performance
    - Style (techniques)
  - Modern elements
    - Sound design: Synth / Effects / Tone / Guitar padel
    - Rhythm: Math rock, odd meters etc
    - ...

- Jazz path
  - Improvisation / Ensemble / Jam
  - **Ear training**
  - Language: Phrasing(thinking) / Grooves (Swing) / Extended harmony / Modes
  - History (Sub genres: Bebop / Fusion / Free Jazz...)

- Classical path
  - **Techniques**
  - Sight reading (and theory?)
  - History (Repertoire and Interpretation)
  - Orchestration

### Personal Reasons

- Learning music as a language
  - Input: discern, understand notes
  - Out: respond music with music
  - Improvisation: spontaneous
- Shocked by the fact, most classical instrumentalists
  - Plays and sight reads effortlessly
  - But has zero music in head

## Where and how to start

Luckly, this is a well established domain:
- Shared language(Jazz Standards, later on this)
- Resources: Books / YouTube videos
- Follow the genre / artists

To answer common questions:
- What key to play?
- What chord to play?
- What song to play?

Here is my attempt to them:

### Find common chord / key to play

*This might be meaningless for instruments like guitar*

First, let's see some aggregated stats:

#### Most common keys

- C, F, G both commonly played in Pop and Jazz
- Eb, Ab, Bb are also common in Jazz
- D, E, A common guitar/Pop keys are barely played

| Key | Count | Percentage |
| :-- | :---- | :--------- |
| F | 254 | 18.38% |
| C | 233 | 16.86% |
| Eb | 208 | 15.05% |
| Bb | 171 | 12.37% |
| G | 118 | 8.54% |
| Ab | 77 | 5.57% |
| Cm | 55 | 3.98% |
| Dm | 40 | 2.89% |
| Db | 37 | 2.68% |
| Fm | 36 | 2.60% |
| Am | 27 | 1.95% |
| Gm | 27 | 1.95% |
| D | 23 | 1.66% |
| Bbm | 18 | 1.30% |

#### Most common chord types

- Jazz is all about tension and release
  - Not surprised dominant chord is the most used
- Jazz is all about minor / major 251
  - Dominant, Minor, Major, Half diminished are the fundamentals

| Key | Count | Percentage |
| :-- | :---- | :--------- |
| Dominant | 	25082 |	40.82% |
| Minor | 18678 |	30.4% |
| Major |	13907 |	22.64% |
| Half diminished | 2377 | 3.87% |
| Diminished | 1312 |	2.14% |
| Aug | 60 | 0.1% |
| Sus |	23 | 0.04% |

#### Most common dominant chords

This can be pretty much inferred from the [Most common keys](#most-common-keys).
- The most common key is F, thus:
- The most common dominant: C(5)
- The most common major: F(1)
- The most common minor: G(2)

| Key | Count | Percentage |

### Find songs to play

Before finding songs, what does it mean to play Jazz?

Suppose we are playing `Blue Bossa`:
1. metadata: what year / what key / what style / time signature
2. strucutre: what form? e.g. `AABA` `ABAC`
3. progressions in each section: | 6m7 - 2m7 (57) | 7h7 37 6m - | 1m 47 7bM7 - | 7h7 37 6m - |
4. breakdown into primitives:
  - major 251: common
  - minor 736: common
  - key changes
    - connect parallel major minor(147b)
    - pivot between 7bM7(7b 2 4 6) and 7h7(7 2 4 6): similar usage in `All the things you are`
5. take a note on primitives and practice them

#### Common Progressions in Jazz

#### Find songs by chord progressions

import { JazzFinder } from './JazzFinder';

### Ultimate Jazz Standards

Standards that includes all the key Jazz progressions:

- All The Things You Are (251 and key changes)
- Stella by Starlight (different 251s, backdoor)
- There Will Never Be Another You (different 251s, backdoor)
- Oleo (Rhythm Change)
- Cherokee (251s, backdoor, 251drops(whole step down modulation))
- (Any suggestions?)

## How to Phrasing

Everyone plays the same progression differently.

Other than accumulating and navigating the chord changes, it's also about how you phrase the same change;

Here is list of ideas I collected:
- rhythm
  - common pattern
  - displacement
  - syncopation
  - modulation: metric modulation etc
  - shift accdental
- target note
  - chord tone
  - color note
- note decoration
  - single note
    - diatonic approach / passing note
    - chromatic note(344#5, 711#2, 7b71 e.g.)
    - double stops
	- multiple notes
    - chord arps
    - scale pattern(1234 e.g.)
    - enclosure
- chord substitution
  - upper structure(chord, penta)
    - e.g. joe pass plays Bb, Eb over Cm
  - tritone sub
  - interchange / borrowed
  - chord scale extension
  - modes
- chord voicing
  - chord inversion
  - spread triads
  - quartal voicing
  - intervallic / random order
- chord scale phrasing
  - 9th 11th arp
  - sequence
  - triad pairs
  - barry harris
  - pat martino
  - tim miller 212
  - bach counterpoint
  - side slipping(play outside)
- motif
  - variation
  - repetition
  - sequence
- phrase structure
  - long short
  - interval sequence
- combination
  - target note + decoration / chord
  - long short
  - arp + sequence
  - ...
- licks breakdown
  - e.g. bp harm min(donna lee)

> I don't really dig pentatonic / blues scale...

## Daily Routine

Here are my buckets, I pick one of them to practice:
- basics (1/3 time)
  - fingering: CAGED, Berklee system
  - fingerboard absolute note recognition (for sight playing)
  - chord arp / scale / patterns (see [How to Phrasing](#how-to-phrasing) section)
  - rhythm
- application (1/3 time)
  - play over chord vamps
  - learn licks
  - songs transcription (for ear training)
- projects (1/3 time)
  - learn big standards
  - write/arrange songs
  - research topics

## Takeaways

Jazz is about
- Ear: can you hear it
- Sing: can you respond to it
- Lifestyle/Routine: make it daily life
- Song: shared language and have something to present
- Mindset: a change in perspective is worth 80 iq
